# milestoneproject1
This is my first Milestone project for the Code Institute.  I chose to make a website for a small hometown gym.  

## UX 
The idea for this page was suggested by my Mentor.  My goal was to give it a nice, simple design and to present the information in the most natural order.  I tried to use Bootstrap exclusively.

## Features
A navbar takes the user to the different parts of the page and, at the end, a button takes him back to the top.  The page starts with a three-slide carousel.  There are three active Social media buttons.

## Technologies
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. Bootstrap (4.0)

## Testing
This site was tested across multiple devices to ensure responsiveness.

## Deployment
This site is hosted using GitHub pages, deployed directly from the master branch.
